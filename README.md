Puts all meat that is defined as coming from a Humanlike race and would cause bad thoughts from eating in its own category 
Also moves meat from Insectoids, rotten meat from [Rotten Meat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466790513), Chaomeat from [Pawnmorpher](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1786466855), and Synthmeat from [Replimat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715402900)
